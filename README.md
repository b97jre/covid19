## Excess of death and cause 

  In this repository I am trying to make sense of all the information that is floating around and a lot of people that I respect are saying very different things and try to make my opinion based on data that is freely available. 
 
 ### Datasets
 
 I have included three datasets.
 
 1. Deathrates per week in different countries. Downloaded from *The Human Mortality Database*
 2. Deathrates per day in Sweden from FHM
 3. Deaths reported of civilians in Syria during the war from 2011.

Right now it is only one script that looks at deaths rates per week over the last years. Script is adapted from 

 ### Comparisons
 
 I have split up the data in contries, age and reason of death. Since all these factors play a big role in death rate in the different subgroups.
 
 
Feel free to copy and share the code if you want to.
